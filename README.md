## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Code

### Adding New Strategies
Create a new strategy class inheriting from `bt.Strategy`:

```python
class YourCustomStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize indicators
        pass
    
    def next(self):
        # Define trading logic
        pass
```

### Adding More Analyzers
Enhance analysis with additional backtrader analyzers:

```python
cerebro.addanalyzer(bt.analyzers.TradeAnalyzer, _name='trades')
cerebro.addanalyzer(bt.analyzers.VWR, _name='vwr')  # Variability-Weighted Return
```

### Testing Different Assets
Change the ticker symbol to test other assets:

```python
ticker = "QQQ"  # NASDAQ-100
ticker = "IWM"  # Russell 2000
ticker = "AAPL" # Individual stocks
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This code is for educational and research purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Always conduct thorough testing and risk assessment before implementing any trading strategy with real money.

As when trying with different assets, you will see that the performance of buy-and-hold strategy is generally better than the breakout strategy.
